I can never say enough how damaging that novel of Bram Stoker has been. Yes, of course, population of Slavic countries place garlic cloves in coffins. Yes, of course, inhabitants of Santorini Island hang garlic on their windows - there would be so much to write about this place, and someday soon, I hope to go back to this island to further explore its occult tradition.

I have seen an enraged Vulp flee when wacked with a rose – yes, a simple rose! I have witnessed a violent Ekon fall down and beg for mercy when stuck by a wooden stake.

Michael appeared to me last night in all his glory, shaped in glorious blood, to grant me eternal life at the dusk of my life. (…) The apparition was so sublime and terrible that I could not help but lower my head and close my eyes. Struck by the divine gift, I fell to the ground, only to awake the next night. “You will serve me as you served your kings”, said the angel before striking me with all his power. “You will protect this land through the eons to come”. (…) For all who knew me, I should now hide and retreat, for they consider me dead. Soon, I will leave the company of men to serve my new purpose. Blessed be God!<lf><lf>1350<lf>Michael appeared to me last night in my retreat under Temple Church and asked me to prepare for battle. The land must be saved. Death is everywhere. The Black Death. An epidemic sent by the Devil himself to punish mortals all over the world. My arm is strong. In the name of God, I shall smite the enemies of mankind. England shall prevail.<lf><lf>1569<lf>It is almost twenty years since my fight started against the Devil and the end is uncertain. From time to time, the plague, the Black Death reappears in a village, in a town, and each time the vicious minions of Hell approach to get their share of the mortals suffering. Vampires. Dreadful creatures. I won’t let this land collapse. Until my last breath, I’ll serve and protect England.<lf><lf> 1578<lf>Tonight, in the small village of Hoddesdon, I met the most delicate soul I’ve seen for a long time. She was singing for the dead, singing for those she knew and loved, those killed by a new plague outbreak, without fearing for her own life. Her voice moved me so I chose to let her live. I offered her eternal life as a reward for her virtue and most pious attitude.  Her name is Elisabeth Englewood. I’m not alone anymore. Together, we shall praise God in all His glory, for the eons to come.<lf><lf>1618 <lf>My heart is breaking. My soul is bleeding. Tonight, my dear Elisabeth left me. I have taught her all I knew; all she needed to know. Now, she must walk her own path through the ages. This is her wish and I will respect it. (…) Elisabeth Englewood, my sweet daughter, is gone, for she now wants to be known as Elisabeth Blackwood. I made her a promise: if she ever comes back to Hoddesdon, she will find me there, managing The Bull Inn her parents owned before dying. (…) William Marshal shall disappear for a few times too now that the Black Death is no more. Until we meet again, I shall be known as William Thorne, waiting for my angel to come back.<lf><lf><lf>1665<lf>The Devil is at work again. The Great Plague is back, reaping thousands of lives in London. I must sell the Bull Inn and go there. Once more, William Marshal shall protect the land.<lf><lf>1666<lf>What have I done? I let the Devil infect me. God, forgive me! The terrifying creature I had to defeat was a demon straight from Hell, an abomination of the flesh, a walking Apocalypse. I had to trap the dreadful creature in Saint Paul’s church and set the building on fire. Without the advice of Michael, I don’t know if I could have defeated my enemy. The flames cleansed the city of the demon’s presence, but half of London burnt down. Ever since, I have dreamt of a red flood, of slaughter and rage. It’s like the Disaster had tainted my blood, my very soul. For the first time in centuries, I am afraid. I shall crawl back to my retreat, and pray to God for mercy for my infected soul.<lf><lf><lf>1667 <lf>Elisabeth came to me. She said she felt my pain and rushed to save me. My poor daughter. Blinded by rage, intoxicated by the blood of hate, I bit her... She fled, shocked by my betrayal. I laughed and cried as she cursed me. God, have I betrayed you? Have you abandoned me?<lf><lf>1712<lf>My prayers have been heard. I have found the strength to resist the need for blood. The never-ending hunger. My poor Elisabeth, will you ever forgive me? I’ve heard you now kill and take pleasure in bloodbath with this new progeny of yours. You’re a victim in all this. What have I done? I swear I will find a way to make amends for what I have done to you. I swear I shall only rest once I know how to appease the blood of hate.<lf><lf><lf>1785<lf>The Brotherhood of the Saint Paul’s Stole finally agreed to meet me in London (…) They proposed to meet inside the new cathedral of Saint Paul. I like the wit and solemnity of these men. What a symbol, to choose the place where I defeated this Disaster, but also the place where I fell. I agreed to their proposition (…) There, in the sacred silence of the church and under the eye of God, they respectfully listened to me. They acknowledged my victory against this evil creature, the Dus-Astro, the “eater of stars” who only wished to spread death and pestilence all around her. Since they acknowledged my will to save London in 1666, they heard my request, my burning desire to stop the blood of hate. Their Primate promised to come back to me with an answer (…) The Primate of Saint Paul wrote back to me with just a name; the Tear of Angels. According to him, this ancient artefact could heal anything. Cleanse any blackened soul and purify my blood. Blessed be the Lord, it took me more than a hundred years to find a cure for the blood of hate, but I may finally have found it. Soon, the rage shall end. Soon, I may repair the wrong I did and cleanse my failures. Now all I need to do is retrieve the necessary ingredients to create the artefact (…) Blood of the purest heart mixed with the blood of a king… To find such rare ingredients is not what worries me the most, for time is on my side. It’s the last part that worries me: pure essence of garlic. I’m afraid it will literally hurt like hell when I drink the antidote. But if that’s the price to pay to cleanse my soul and correct my mistakes, I am ready to endure this excruciating pain.<lf><lf><lf>1786<lf><lf>I finally managed to gather all the ingredients needed to concoct the Tear of Angels: Blood of the purest heart for the fortitude, Blood of a king for courage, Garlic essence, for the painful cleansing. After months of impatience, almost made mad by the hunger, I waited again and again, until finally Elisabeth cautiously came to me. As promised, I had chained myself to be sure I would not attack her again. I did not recognize my sweet daughter at first, for she only was Lady Blackwood now, the dreadful mistress of the dark who took delight in slaughter and carnage in France. She smirked as I apologized and cried for what I had inflicted to her. She shouted at me when I tried to explain to her that my bite had infected her, had given her the blood of hate, now burning in her veins, in her soul. I told her I have found a cure, and that I had managed to create one dose of antidote… I gave it to her, to give her back her previous peaceful life. In exchange, I only asked her to take care of me, for I intended to be locked down in my tomb, chained if necessary, to impeach me from feeding on any mortal or immortal. She reluctantly took the Tear of Angels and left. I hope to see her again soon, cured and at peace. <lf><lf><lf><lf><lf>1794<lf>She came back to me finally. Cured. Healthy. Joyful. My Elisabeth. She told me she had drunk the antidote about a year ago in France, after witnessing – and taking part in – the massacre of an entire orphanage caused by the blood of hate. That’s when the Lady Blackwood died, she said. She promised she would take care of me, now. That’s all I ask as I repent for all the murdered souls caused by my negligence of more than a hundred years.<lf><lf>1795<lf>My dearest daughter came back last week to tell me the good news. She has recently bought a castle in Scotland. She will soon finance the renovation of the castle crypt to provide me a new retreat. Far from temptation, far from the noisy, crowded cities. I can’t wait to embrace the solitude. Find the peace I need to refrain from killing. God, please give me the strength to resist the urges during the journey from London to my new domain. Before I leave, I should give a copy of these memoirs to the Brotherhood of Saint Paul’s Stole, without the most shameful and sensible information, of course. Soon, I shall leave London to pursue my penance. There, I shall find peace at last, with the support of my resuscitated Elisabeth.<lf>","1217<lf>An angel came to me… Blessed be to God! Michael appeared to me last night in all his glory, shaped in glorious blood, to grant me eternal life at the dusk of my life. (…) The apparition was so sublime and terrible that I could not help but lower my head and close my eyes. Struck by the divine gift, I fell to the ground, only to awake the next night. “You will serve me as you served your kings”, said the angel before striking me with all his power. “You will protect this land through the eons to come”. (…) For all who knew me, I should now hide and retreat, for they consider me dead. Soon, I will leave the company of men to serve my new purpose. Blessed be God!<lf><lf>1350<lf>Michael appeared to me last night in my retreat under Temple Church and asked me to prepare for battle. The land must be saved. Death is everywhere. The Black Death. An epidemic sent by the Devil himself to punish mortals all over the world. My arm is strong. In the name of God, I shall smite the enemies of mankind. England shall prevail.<lf><lf>1569<lf>It is almost twenty years since my fight started against the Devil and the end is uncertain. From time to time, the plague, the Black Death reappears in a village, in a town, and each time the vicious minions of Hell approach to get their share of the mortals suffering. Vampires. Dreadful creatures. I won’t let this land collapse. Until my last breath, I’ll serve and protect England.<lf><lf> 1578<lf>Tonight, in the small village of Hoddesdon, I met the most delicate soul I’ve seen for a long time. She was singing for the dead, singing for those she knew and loved, those killed by a new plague outbreak, without fearing for her own life. Her voice moved me so I chose to let her live. I offered her eternal life as a reward for her virtue and most pious attitude.  Her name is Elisabeth Englewood. I’m not alone anymore. Together, we shall praise God in all His glory, for the eons to come.<lf><lf>1618 <lf>My heart is breaking. My soul is bleeding. Tonight, my dear Elisabeth left me. I have taught her all I knew; all she needed to know. Now, she must walk her own path through the ages. This is her wish and I will respect it. (…) Elisabeth Englewood, my sweet daughter, is gone, for she now wants to be known as Elisabeth Blackwood. I made her a promise: if she ever comes back to Hoddesdon, she will find me there, managing The Bull Inn her parents owned before dying. (…) William Marshal shall disappear for a few times too now that the Black Death is no more. Until we meet again, I shall be known as William Thorne, waiting for my angel to come back.<lf><lf><lf>1665<lf>The Devil is at work again. The Great Plague is back, reaping thousands of lives in London. I must sell the Bull Inn and go there. Once more, William Marshal shall protect the land.<lf><lf>1666<lf>What have I done? I let the Devil infect me. God, forgive me! The terrifying creature I had to defeat was a demon straight from Hell, an abomination of the flesh, a walking Apocalypse. I had to trap the dreadful creature in Saint Paul’s church and set the building on fire. Without the advice of Michael, I don’t know if I could have defeated my enemy. The flames cleansed the city of the demon’s presence, but half of London burnt down. Ever since, I have dreamt of a red flood, of slaughter and rage. It’s like the Disaster had tainted my blood, my very soul. For the first time in centuries, I am afraid. I shall crawl back to my retreat, and pray to God for mercy for my infected soul.<lf><lf><lf>1667 <lf>Elisabeth came to me. She said she felt my pain and rushed to save me. My poor daughter. Blinded by rage, intoxicated by the blood of hate, I bit her... She fled, shocked by my betrayal. I laughed and cried as she cursed me. God, have I betrayed you? Have you abandoned me?<lf><lf>1712<lf>My prayers have been heard. I have found the strength to resist the need for blood. The never-ending hunger. My poor Elisabeth, will you ever forgive me? I’ve heard you now kill and take pleasure in bloodbath with this new progeny of yours. You’re a victim in all this. What have I done? I swear I will find a way to make amends for what I have done to you. I swear I shall only rest once I know how to appease the blood of hate.<lf><lf><lf>1785<lf>The Brotherhood of the Saint Paul’s Stole finally agreed to meet me in London (…) They proposed to meet inside the new cathedral of Saint Paul. I like the wit and solemnity of these men. What a symbol, to choose the place where I defeated this Disaster, but also the place where I fell. I agreed to their proposition (…) There, in the sacred silence of the church and under the eye of God, they respectfully listened to me. They acknowledged my victory against this evil creature, the Dus-Astro, the “eater of stars” who only wished to spread death and pestilence all around her. Since they acknowledged my will to save London in 1666, they heard my request, my burning desire to stop the blood of hate. Their Primate promised to come back to me with an answer (…) The Primate of Saint Paul wrote back to me with just a name; the Tear of Angels.

And if it is not enough, I know where to find more.<lf>17th October<lf>Father Whitaker and I went to an abandoned house near Saint Mary’s Church. It was an awful and smelly place; rats were disputing the rooms to the last remaining residents of the decrepit flats. Most of them are sick. Awful, awful odours! On the last floor, Father Whitaker found an old man lying on a dirty mattress, coughing and spitting blood in a wooden bowl. Father Whitaker knelt before him and prayed a long time. The man seemed to feel better. Then we both helped him find the light. I cried then and I cry now as I write these lines, for I’ve never seen a soul so relieved to be finally redeemed. Father Whitaker is a saint. If it’s not presumptuous nor a sinful expression of pride, I wish I’ll be able to save as many souls as he does, for it’s a real privilege to witness such miracles.<lf>19th October<lf>Tonight, we both went to the whorehouses boarding the canal. I must admit I was very afraid to cross the path of Jezebels, but the buildings were abandoned for a long time. Whores and infections go together, explained Father Whitaker, but their customers quickly get scared when there is mention of disease. In the last brothel, we found two sick women, sleeping together in a sinful attitude under dirty blankets. The odour was awful, once more. The smell of Satan and of the disease explained Father Whitaker, before kneeling and praying for these two lost souls. The women were so frail and sick they were not able to move when I threw the petrol on the blankets. Their souls are now cleansed and purified.<lf>21st of October<lf>Father Whitaker is a saint. I won’t let anyone mock the holy man he is. He shall receive more help and support. But, as all the true prophets, he is alone. He needs more from his followers. He needs love, and proof of love.

The dead have no need of the terrestrial goods, but we need to eat, father Whitaker and I.<lf>27th of October<lf>Tonight, for the first time it was my turn to lead the round. I chose to return where we went ten days ago, to see if any more souls needed to be freed. Father Whitaker approved my choice, since the good man’s work is never finished, and Satan never sleeps, he explained. He also said, if I keep showing so much zeal, he may soon give me more important missions and tasks. I can’t wait. Three more souls have been cleansed from any corruption, tonight. If it’s not presumptuous nor a sinful expression of pride, I dare to say we are one a path to greatest.","12th October<lf>Father Whitaker is so righteous, so full of compassion and love for the suffering ones.

It was an awful and smelly place; rats were disputing the rooms to the last remaining residents of the decrepit flats. Most of them are sick. Awful, awful odours! On the last floor, Father Whitaker found an old man lying on a dirty mattress, coughing and spitting blood in a wooden bowl. Father Whitaker knelt before him and prayed a long time. The man seemed to feel better. Then we both helped him find the light. I cried then and I cry now as I write these lines, for I’ve never seen a soul so relieved to be finally redeemed. Father Whitaker is a saint. If it’s not presumptuous nor a sinful expression of pride, I wish I’ll be able to save as many souls as he does, for it’s a real privilege to witness such miracles.<lf>19th October<lf>Tonight, we both went to the whorehouses boarding the canal. I must admit I was very afraid to cross the path of Jezebels, but the buildings were abandoned for a long time. Whores and infections go together, explained Father Whitaker, but their customers quickly get scared when there is mention of disease. In the last brothel, we found two sick women, sleeping together in a sinful attitude under dirty blankets. The odour was awful, once more. The smell of Satan and of the disease explained Father Whitaker, before kneeling and praying for these two lost souls. The women were so frail and sick they were not able to move when I threw the petrol on the blankets. Their souls are now cleansed and purified.<lf>21st of October<lf>Father Whitaker is a saint. I won’t let anyone mock the holy man he is. He shall receive more help and support. But, as all the true prophets, he is alone. He needs more from his followers. He needs love, and proof of love. Tomorrow, I shall go back to the cemetery, and unearth more wealth for him. The dead have no need of the terrestrial goods, but we need to eat, father Whitaker and I.<lf>27th of October<lf>Tonight, for the first time it was my turn to lead the round. I chose to return where we went ten days ago, to see if any more souls needed to be freed. Father Whitaker approved my choice, since the good man’s work is never finished, and Satan never sleeps, he explained. He also said, if I keep showing so much zeal, he may soon give me more important missions and tasks. I can’t wait. Three more souls have been cleansed from any corruption, tonight. If it’s not presumptuous nor a sinful expression of pride, I dare to say we are one a path to greatest.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of them, according to some informants, could be the ritual of the so-called “Ban of the Dragon”. <lf><lf>It seems that, in certain conditions, when the Brothers of Saint Paul find a violent or bloodthirsty immortal, they call upon him this Ban. What it is exactly? I don’t know. Does it really exist? I don’t know for sure either. But what I’ve established as facts, it is that whenever a hostile or vindictive vampire has threatened London, it disappeared without a trace after the Brotherhood pronounced a Ban upon him. The loyal Fergal Bansha himself has never been foolish enough to openly provoke the Brotherhood. This is a lesson we must all remember: never be considered a Dragon by the Brotherhood.<lf><lf>From “The law of Ascalon” by Lord Redgrave, founder<lf>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But for me, this is not the most important characteristic of their diet. What has always fascinated me, since I started to study them, is the imperative need for blood they seem to endure. They want it more than anything, and this desire can drive them to expose themselves. And when they drink it, they seem to feel some sort of short trance. “An ecstatic epiphany”, said to me once a Vulkod I interviewed in Moscow. I’m convinced that this is an essential element to understand the nature and condition of the vampires: they don’t drink blood because it sustains them, but that it offers them ecstasy. Vampires are addicted to blood, all of them. It is part of their nature and those, among the immortals, who refuse to submit to their appetite by the strength of their will only, are never freed from this addiction.<lf><lf>From “Unveiling the night” by Usher Talltree, Primate of Saint Paul","Vampires drink blood.

I’m starting to worry, since my vision has decreased more and more over the past months. I’m afraid I may go blind before finding any interesting lead. Maybe I should go back to the Brotherhood’s library and ask our Primate if he knows of any documents I should read first… But I fear he might refuse to answer me.

I talked to him last night and he kindly listed me three scrolls I should read. Good thing my Greek and Latin are not too rusty.<lf><lf>15.07.18<lf>I’m losing patience and time here. The precious texts listed by the Primate have proved themselves almost totally useless. Alchemy and herbalist knowledge won’t do me much good. For three days now, I’m totally blind as soon as the evening comes. This can’t happen. This won’t be!<lf><lf>17.08.18<lf>A terrible idea has come to my mind: what if I used the regenerative power of vampire blood? I’ll go back to the Brotherhood’s secret library tonight, and search for such information and material. With the influenza crisis, it should be easier to sneak in.<lf><lf>21.08.18<lf>I’m on to something! The eyes of the two last rats I blinded seemed to have retrieved sight after I injected them with a drop of vampire blood.

I must find a way to improve the recipe. <lf><lf>14.09.18<lf>I’ve been unable to find some more vampire blood. I think someone spotted my theft in the Brotherhood cabinet.

It had been a long time since I went in this sad part of town. To see her talking and listening to those poor people moved me beyond words. She really tries to make a difference, and really tries to help these men and women. She also killed one of them tonight. It happened so quickly I did not even notice she had vanished, but when she reappeared, she looked so much more alive, more vivid. I immediately knew what had just happened.

I called for help as loud as I could, like mother told me. I don’t know what would have happened if a soldier had not ordered them to leave me alone. He then walked me back home and tried to kiss me. I refused. He did not say a word and left. The whole story made me so sad I was still crying when mother woke up after the night had come. I told her the whole truth and she held me against her chest. Then we went to the theatre to see Doris Fletcher in her new play. I think I’m a little bit frustrated that mother did not rush out to make them all pay! If I were a vampire, I would not be that merciful.<lf><lf>15th September 1914<lf>We had a terrible argument with mother last night, as she refused once again to turn me into an immortal. When I reminded her of what had happened to me in that street with those two men, and how things would have been different if I had been like her, or if they had carried weapons, she simply smiled and told me that to be part of this world meant to be ready to face it. I’m not sure I understand what she means, but it drives me crazy. I left home in the middle of the night to see Emily at her house, and I spent the whole day there. Maybe it’s time for me to leave mother’s house and live my life, just like Emily. I love mother so much, but it frustrates me so when she refuses to talk about my… conversion.<lf><lf>17th February 1915<lf>Tonight, I’m as sad as I am excited, for I’m about to leave this house for good. Mother has agreed to let me have my own flat in the West End, as long as it is not too far from her house. I had to promise her I would be very careful. I told her how much I love her and she told me she was proud of me. I understand now that she only wants me to be as strong and independent as she is. I must admit I am very thankful for all she taught me through these years. She made the woman I am today. Now it’s time for me to choose where to go from here. Whatever I’m going to do with my life, it’s up to me. All I know is this: if I ever chose to become an immortal, I will not involve my mother in my choice.

I think I’m a little bit frustrated that mother did not rush out to make them all pay! If I were a vampire, I would not be that merciful.<lf><lf>15th September 1914<lf>We had a terrible argument with mother last night, as she refused once again to turn me into an immortal. When I reminded her of what had happened to me in that street with those two men, and how things would have been different if I had been like her, or if they had carried weapons, she simply smiled and told me that to be part of this world meant to be ready to face it. I’m not sure I understand what she means, but it drives me crazy. I left home in the middle of the night to see Emily at her house, and I spent the whole day there. Maybe it’s time for me to leave mother’s house and live my life, just like Emily. I love mother so much, but it frustrates me so when she refuses to talk about my… conversion.<lf><lf>17th February 1915<lf>Tonight, I’m as sad as I am excited, for I’m about to leave this house for good. Mother has agreed to let me have my own flat in the West End, as long as it is not too far from her house. I had to promise her I would be very careful. I told her how much I love her and she told me she was proud of me. I understand now that she only wants me to be as strong and independent as she is. I must admit I am very thankful for all she taught me through these years. She made the woman I am today. Now it’s time for me to choose where to go from here. Whatever I’m going to do with my life, it’s up to me. All I know is this: if I ever chose to become an immortal, I will not involve my mother in my choice. For this is my life, and I’m responsible for my actions.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I don’t accept it so I left. Just like you left us to become the great surgeon you are destined to be. The great surgeon I never want to see next to me, looking at me knowing I will die soon.

We are, in all ways, members of the good society, sometimes recognized as public figures. We do not find our delight in orgies and bloodbath, like our adversaries assert we do. And if one of us were caught in such caricatured and immoral act, he would receive the appropriate opprobrium. But what about the blood? What about its recreational use? How could we deny the ecstasy the vermillion ambrosia brings us? And with what else could we toast with, as any good fraternity should? To answer this delicate question, the law of conduct inside the club goes as follow: as long as the original mortal vessel is not brought inside our walls, each member is allowed to drink whatever he wants, for his own usage or to share it with friends.

Here are some of the most fascinating abilities I’ve personally observed over the last ten years while interviewing a few vampires, or “Ekon”, as they prefer to call themselves.<lf><lf>SUPERNATURAL SPEED: A vampire can act and move like a mortal in all his actions, but the trained eye will spot that they have the keenest senses, and can react quicker than any mortal. On a few occasions (alarm, surprise, necessity to flee), I have seen a vampire move so quickly it is almost as if he had vanished just to reappear somewhere else. The human eye cannot follow their movements when they act so quickly, but it is not a teleport or dematerialisation. It is only a supernatural speed. For me, it is a catlike attribute, which allows them to run, dodge, or jump longer and faster than us. I also noticed that such speed seems to exhaust them, and that they are bound to physical limitations.<lf><lf>MESMERISM: One of the most powerful abilities a vampire can deploy is the capacity to force a mortal to obey them. I call this trait mesmerism, but it has nothing to do with the mortal ability to alter a subject’s mental state. A vampire can bend a mortal to their will, and they can even break a mind. A vampire I interviewed even told me the more a subject tries to resist, the more permanent the damage will be, as if the vampire could literally fracture their target’s psyche. The same vampire explained to me that this ability required time to master, and that the result could vary widely from one subject to another: implant a false memory, erase a painful one, the possibilities are endless… and frightening. <lf><lf>BLOOD AWARENESS: This may be the most catastrophic ability of all, concerning vampires, since it is the cause of so many tragedies for them and us. Vampires crave for blood. They must use their will to restrain themselves from frenziedly drinking every drop of blood they can see. They need blood to function, and to express their full supernatural traits. A famished vampire can be very weak, even if he cannot die of hunger or thirst. This urge, this need for blood may explain why a vampire is so aroused by it. A vampire confessed to me that blood could sometimes blind him, since its smell and attractiveness can be so strong. When he focuses, a vampire can almost “see” blood all around them – inside warm bodies, through walls, on a supposedly clean weapon, etc. The same vampire even told me that he can see if a mortal has clean blood or is ill, and that in some cases he can even sense diseases, infected clothes, or even items in a room. If this is true, it could have so many medical applications it almost beggars belief!","It is a rare opportunity, and almost a privilege to approach a vampire, to observe their most intriguing physical, and psychological traits with a scientific and rational eye.

But what is really going on, there? Is it the only way for a vampire to... breed? Let’s review what we know so far. When willing to create a progeny, a vampire will not bite but give its blood to drink. Most of the victims die when bitten, but some of them survive and turn into leeches themselves. This only happens when they have assimilated the vampire blood, one way or another. It is not the predator’s bite, but its blood, that infects the victim who will turn if he or she survives the suffering of the metamorphosis.<lf><lf>It also seems that a vampire can breed by having intercourse: the vampire mates to produce a… child. Sexual intercourse between vampire and human rarely produce any birth, but some of them tried anyway. A vampire gestation is only a few weeks short and the pain is almost unbearable for the mother. If she is mortal, she will not survive the birth: the vampire comes out of her womb by tearing apart her entrails. If the mother is a blood drinker, it will probably survive and regenerate.
