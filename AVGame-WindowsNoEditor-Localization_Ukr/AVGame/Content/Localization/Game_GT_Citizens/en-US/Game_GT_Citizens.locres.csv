Son of Benjamin Palmer, a former soldier and traumatized veteran, Albert followed his father to the streets when the raging alcoholic could not provide the rent anymore. Instead of staying by Benjamin’s side, Albert decided to fend for himself and struck out alone to become a common thief. To ensure his survival, he approached the members of the Wet Boot Boys and started to carry out menial tasks for the gang - going so far as to steal his father’s medicine to prove his worth. The young Mr. Palmer built up resentment towards his father and society itself turned him into a wild dog desperately trying to fit in among wolves. He was terrified to die and his blood left an oddly bitter aftertaste.","Albert Palmer, 18 years old, male. A homeless young man devoured by his desire to become a gang member.

Also known as, 'Father Whitaker' although this man was never ordinated, and had no relation to the Church. Mr. Whitaker confronted Skals the very day he arrived in Whitechapel, and the encounter was the last proof he needed of the city's fall from grace. Convinced that the epidemic and those beasts were signs of divine retribution, he embarked on a holy war against the impurities of London, and relied on one all-powerful weapon: fire. He didn’t bother to keep track of the number of victims he immolated as the tally rose rapidly. Mr. Whitaker had a very strict creed of exclusively only burning those that were sick.

He spent his youth in a Catholic orphanage, and at fifteen was molested by one of the priests who raised him. The young man, his body and faith violated, fled to London to start life anew, and rebuild his identity. His empathy with lost souls led him to become their benefactor: revolted by the pain, sickness, and loneliness of the poor, Sean Hampton created a sanctuary in an abandoned warehouse. An asylum for the desperate. It was a place of serenity where men, and Skals could pray and cry with the forsaken. The inhabitants of the Docks respected him and nicknamed him, the 'Sad Saint,' crowning his awkward faith as the only ray of hope in this lawless part of the city. Even the gangs silently agreed to leave his shelter untouched. His quest for salvation would have known no end. When I killed him, I felt his unconditional love for all those who lived under God – mortal, or immortal. Sean Hampton’s dedication for the forsaken souls was absolute and real. It was so pure, so compassionate, and so deeply rooted in the man’s inner injuries, that it almost frightened me. For I felt in his zeal the seeds of fanaticism, and the kind of implacable conviction that can create miracles, or bring catastrophe into this world.","Sean Patrick Hampton, 38 years old, male.

In 1916 she witnessed the defeat of everything that she believed in, and that ended with the repression of her people, and the slaughter of her loved ones. She fled to England with her sister and her brother in law. Together, they embraced the life of exiles, and finally ended up in Whitechapel. <lf>Her medical background allowed Dorothea to find work as a nurse at the Pembroke Hospital. She changed her name to Dorothy Crane and worked hard within those walls. But when the Spanish Flu epidemic hit London, her activist instincts drove her to aid the suffering and dying migrants within Whitechapel. With the help of Darius Petrescu, another old Romanian activist she knew from her partisan years, she set up a dispensary. Thereafter she made some dubious choices and alliances to finance this illegal haven. Dorothy stole, bribed, and even blackmailed the wealthy to get the money to support it. The night she suspected Lady Ashbury of deviant attitudes – without even realizing what kind of deadly foe she was threatening – she went one step too far.<lf>As she died in my arms, she remembered all the legends from her homeland and found the energy to scold me for what I was, and what I chose to do. Dorothea Craciunescu never surrendered, even in death.","","","","","",""

She had lost him to disease - I couldn't identify the actual ailment from her memories, for her husband had taken good care to hide his symptoms from his wife. It’s unclear whether she could have noticed his lies and done something about his affliction. The guilt she developed turned into the main component of Mrs. Hsiao Shun's life. The widow became disconnected from reality and dedicated herself to mourn the tomb of her late husband, spending days and nights alike by the side of the grave and lingering on her mistakes. I wonder how her life would have evolved without my intervention: would she have stayed in the East End? Would she have regained her composure? Either way, she now rests by his side.","","","","","",""

A crooked landlord from Whitechapel, Mr. Bates made his fortune offering accommodations to immigrants in need then extorting them for rent at any cost. The extortion was so severe that many tenants had to sell themselves just to keep their mediocre shelters. Of course, Mr. Bates presented himself as a facilitator for such methods. He fished for most of these lost souls in Nurse Dorothy Crane's dispensary, selecting his future residents by the colour of their skin and their difficulty in handling the language. He made no secret of his profound racism. The skals that had attempted to kill him were former tenants, driven by the urge to avenge themselves, and end the existence of their wretched landlord. Mr. Bates had a clear understanding about the villainy of his actions, and the hatred people had for him. He died regretting his lack of loved ones.","Cadogan Bates, 45 years old, male.
